# 1. Project Overview
This is an end-to-end data analytics project where I analyzed OLA ride data using SQL, Excel and Power BI.  
The goal was to clean, transform and visualize the data to uncover business insights such as revenue trends, cancellations and customer/driver ratings.

# 2. Tools & Technologies
- SQL → Data extraction, cleaning, and transformations. 
- Excel → Data preprocessing and exploration.

The Power BI report consists of 5 interactive pages:
1. Overall Summary – Total bookings, successful rides, and cancellations.  
2. Vehicle Type Analysis – Performance comparison across ride categories. 
3. Revenue Insights – Payment methods, revenue by vehicle type, and top customers.  
4. Cancellation Analysis – Trends in driver vs. customer cancellations.  
5. Ratings Overview – Comparison of customer and driver ratings.
